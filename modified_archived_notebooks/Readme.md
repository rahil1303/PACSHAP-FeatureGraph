## 🛠️ Modified Archived Notebooks

### 📖 Description
This folder contains notebooks adapted and modified from the original archived reference notebooks associated with the research paper titled **["Data minimization for GDPR compliance in machine learning models"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2022.102808)** by Goldsteen et al. (2022). The original implementation and datasets became outdated and incompatible with current library versions and dependencies.

### 🎯 Purpose
The goal of these modified notebooks is to revive the original implementation, ensuring compatibility with updated libraries, dependencies, and current machine learning practices, while preserving the original intent and methodologies described in the research.

### ✏️ Modifications Made

- **Updated and re-written** code sections to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Python packages and libraries.
- **Replaced or modified** datasets and data loading mechanisms to match current data availability and formats.
- **Adjusted functionalities and workflows** to reflect best practices and ensure reproducibility and functionality.

### ✅ Status
- **Working:** Notebooks have been tested and are functional under current dependency and library versions.

### 📜 Citation
If referencing these modified notebooks, please cite the original research paper.
